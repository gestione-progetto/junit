### Exercise n. 1

Write a set of test cases, specific sets of data, to test properly the following program.

**The program reads three integer values from an input dialog.    
The three values represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle.   
The program displays a message that states whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral.**

>Remember that a scalene triangle is one where no two sides are equal, 
whereas an isosceles triangle has two equal sides, and an equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length.
